# giphy-gallery

Pretty cute but also lame exercise to call Giphy API to request
some animated GIFs about specific subjects. 

Four animals are present as buttons by default. Feel free to add
new ones by entering it into the field and hit ADD button. 

Then pressing one of the buttons (other than ADD) will pull up 
10 Giphy animated gifs. The catch is, you have to click on the
picture to make it animate. Click again to reset to static.
